        <h3>Mission</h3>

        <p>The purpose of Investment Assistant is to aid investors in their
          investments. Our application runs continuously as
          a background process and periodically retrieves stock information
          from various financial websites that collects stock price data. It
          will then parse the received responses, extract all necessary
          parameters and store them in a local relational database.</p>

        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>We are building an application that is designed to educated its
          users about the stock market. In the stock market, its investors seek
          to obtain part ownership of a company. Because a company can have
          thousands of stocks, most investors tend own tiny portions of the
          business. Stock sales are a way to increase revenue without borrowing,
          in the traditional sense. Investors purchase stock with the intent to
          grow their money over time. Our application will inform investors of
          the desirability of the stock. The desirability of the stock will
          increase the ask price and the bid price. This information is handle
          by technology and when the ask price and the bid price align that
          equates to a sale.

          Our application will aid in investors to creating a diverse investment
          portfolio. A diverse portfolio over time will help investors weather
          the storm in the long run. Helping them prepare for retirement down
          the road. Having accurate picture in trends will inform investors when
          it is the right time buy stock and when it the right time to sale.</p>
